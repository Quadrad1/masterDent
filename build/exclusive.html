        <p>It is an infection which affects the outer ear canal. The technical term
          for swimmers ear is known as otitis externa. It is a very common problem
          among children. As it mainly affects swimmers it is known as the swimmers
          ear. But it is not only restricted to swimmers. People having bath or are
          in shower may also be get affected by this infection.</p>

        <p>It is caused when water gets accumulated in the ear canal and leads to
          an infection. This infection causes swelling, redness, heat and pain.
          Infection leads to formation of pus which oozes out from the ear. There
          can be itchiness so any slight movement or touching of the ear can
          cause lot of pain. The infection is induced due to a germ called
          Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is commonly found in soil and water.
          Polluted water is the major cause of this trouble. Swimming in polluted
          lakes and rivers can be very hazardous. If your children are swimming in
          an enclosed pool environment you still cannot be sure about the cleanliness
          of the water. Even when water is chlorinated you may not escape the bacteria.
          Bacteria grows when the water get accumulated in the ear canal. It washes
          away the protective earwax coating leading to an infection. The moistness
          of the ear may lead to vulnerability of ear and become prone to an
          infection. Fungal infection and constant diving are some of the causes
          for this infection.</p>

        <p>Once detected you should avoid getting into the water. Allow time to
          heal your wounds before you jump back in. Wear shower caps when in
          shower to restrict water from getting into your ears. You can wear ear
          plugs or cotton balls to prevent water from entering your ears. Avoid
          fidgeting your ears with cotton swabs or any pointed objects.
          Your doctor will treat this problem by prescribing some ear drops. Due
          to the immense pain he may even prescribe pain killers. These antibiotics
          drops may help to clear the problem. By taking some precautionary measures
          you can avoid this problem too. Always keep your ears dry. If any amount
          of water gets into your ears remove by using an alcohol-based product.
          Avoid swimming in polluted areas.</p>

        <p>There are some common symptoms which can help you detect swimmers ear.
          Your ear becomes very sensitive and gives you the feeling of being choked.
          You may suffer from fever and hearing gets deteriorated. The pain in the
          ear may spread through the neck, face or part of your face.
          Home Remedies</p>

        <p>The mixture of alcohol and white vinegar should be used in 1:1 proportion.
          A few drops of this mixture would evaporate all the moisture from your ear.
          Use a hairdryer by keeping it in the warm setting using it over your ear to dry it.
          Warning: The reader of this article should exercise all precautionary
          measures while following instructions on the home remedies from this
          article. Avoid using any of these products if you are allergic to it.
          The responsibility lies with the reader and not with the site or the writer.</p>

        <p>Here, I focus on a range of items and features that we use in life without giving them a second thought such as Coca Cola, body muscles and holding ones own breath. Though, most of these notes are not fundamentally necessary, they are such that you can use them for a good laugh, at a drinks party or for picking up women or men.</p>

        <p>1) Coca-Cola: Did you know that its original colour was green?</p>

        <p>2) Mohammed: Did you know that this is the most used name in the entire world?</p>

        <p>3) Geographical Letters: Did you know that the name of each of the continents
          begins and concludes with the exact same alphabet? Do not believe that? Look
          up Asia, Europe, Africa, America, Antarctica and the rest.</p>
        <p>4) Muscle Strength: Did you know that the strongest muscle in the entire body
          is that one which we use to lick a popsicle? Your tongue.</p>

        <p>5) Credit Cards: In the United States, were you aware that each and every
          person has at least two credit cards?</p>

        <p>6) An Antique Machine: The word for an old machine that was once used for
          writing letters and other documents is the largest word that one can make
          if they click only on a single row of their computer’s keyboard: typewriter!</p>

        <p>7) Blink: Men wink at women, but research has found out that the average
          woman blinks nearly two times more than the average man.</p>
        <p>8) Suicide: Even though you might have wondered if it was possible, studies have
          discovered that it is impossible to kill oneself by simply holding in your breath.</p>

        <p>9) Licking: However much you may try, you will never be able to lick your elbows.</p>
        <p>10) Sneeze: Try sneezing. People will automatically answer you with a bless you
          greeting. Have you ever imagined why? Some say that this happens because a sneeze
          stops the functioning of the heart for a very tiny second.</p>

        <p>11) The Blue Sky: Did you know that a pig, no matter how much they try, cannot
          look up into the sky?</p>

        <p>12) Twisting Your Tongue: We have all dabbled with different tongue-twisters in
          our day. But do you know which is the toughest? Sixth sick sheiks sixth sheeps sick.</p>

        <p>13) Ribs: Did you know that you should try not to sneeze too strongly. Why? A
          very powerful sneeze has the ability to cause a fracture in your ribcage. But,
          then again, if you try and withhold one, you stand the chance of breaking one of
          the many blood vessels in your neck or head. This could cause death.</p>

        <p>14) Cards: Did you think that the Kings are all just random cards referring to
          random figures? No. Each one signifies a different king: Diamonds for Julius Caesar,
          Clubs for Alexander the Great, Spades for David and Hearts for Charlemagne.</p>

        <p>15) And finally: Most everyone reading this (Caught You!) are trying to lick
          their elbows at this exact moment!</p>

        <p>1. Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are searching
          for a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to
          post once and they are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of
          your time when you don’t have to resubmit your information every week or
          every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I
          still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day
          and set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to do
          it again for at least 6 months.</p>

        <p>2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think
          about it. Where do people go when they are looking for a job? That’s
          right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
          have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds
          bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on them and weed the others
          out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t
          have to be later on when you get the hang of things.</p>

       <p> 3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about
         your product or</p> <!-- service is to write an article about it. In your authors
         resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can go
         to check out your product or service. This is also an excellent way to
         get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of webmasters
         out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their site.
         If they post yours, that is another site that is doing the advertising
         for you. All for free.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise
          your site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you
          get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s
          it. It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once
          every 3 months and do this.</p>

        <p>5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file
          when you sign up on some forums. It will be displayed every time you make
          a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on, and can
          give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off
          the forum and you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and
          answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great
          because once you make a post it stays there forever. It will get moved to
          the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if they were
          searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.</p>

       <p> 6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for
         free, but definately the most effective. Most forums I have visited have
         said in many posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic
         exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you
         do have the option of buying them. I would look into a program that lets
         you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are others
         and they are free to download. That way you can just spend one hour a day
         and get all your surfing in at once.</p>
        7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind
        of business. You can usually mail the group once per day, but I would
        encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each day. People
        will tune you out if they see the same message all the time. Remember
        to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same interests as yours.
        In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are
        advertising shaving cream. -->
